* DONE Figure out how to reimpose neumann on restricted cold domain 
* DONE Do L2 projection for porosity source term in elliptic equation for Pc
* DONE get correct matrix dimensions for temperate region
* DONE get compaction solver working
* DONE get porosity solver working

* TODO is neumann correct for compaction? Don't think so probably has something to do with moving the gravity term to the RHS to early.

* TODO Fix spatially variable coefficents and non varying to make cleaner.

* TODO redo basis functions so they are at Legendre polynomial roots and GLL will produce diagonal mass matrix

* TODO fix Neumann boundary instability for higher order elements ??? UGH
